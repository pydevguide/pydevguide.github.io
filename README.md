# Python Developer Guide (static site)

This repo contains a single-page static website: a compact Python developer guide with sections on important topics, curated learning resources (courses & YouTube channels), career paths, AI with Python, and information about Python's creator.

Files:
- `index.html` — main site
- `styles.css` — styling for the site

Preview locally:

1. Run a simple HTTP server from the project root:

```bash
python3 -m http.server 8000
```

2. Open http://localhost:8000 in your browser.

Next steps (suggestions):
- Add images, logos, or icons to the site for visual polish.
- Move styles to a CSS framework (Tailwind/Bootstrap) if you prefer rapid changes.
- Deploy to GitHub Pages by enabling Pages in the repository settings or add a GitHub Actions workflow for automatic deploys.
